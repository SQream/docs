        <h1>SQream DB Version 3.0</h1>
        <p>Release Notes - January 21, 2019</p>
        <h2>What's New</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>UDFs are now bound to the permission system.<br />By default, only a superuser has the permission to execute and drop UDFs.</li>
            <li>Database administrators can now grant and revoke permissions regarding UDF execution and dropping, like other database objects.</li>
            <li>SQream DB comes with a new dynamic Workload Management (WLM), that allows for better load balancing. A service name can now be assigned to each SQream DB instance, which allows the database administrator to allocate resources to user groups or process types dynamically.</li>
            <li>Based on customer feedback, we’ve completely rewritten our ODBC driver. The new driver is much faster and more stable than the previous one. We highly recommend the update, as this new driver fixes many legacy problems.</li>
            <li>SQream DB v3.0 is now certified for IBM Power9 systems. Our results show some queries are up to 3.7x faster, and load performance 1.7x faster on average.</li>
            <li>SQream DB is now distributed as a docker image. Contact us for more information!</li>
        </ul>
