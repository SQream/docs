            <p>External tables are structured DDL that allow SQream to access data that which is stored outside the database in a none-SQream format, and to query it via SQL commands.
Upon creation, the user should specify the external files format and location, and the needed table DDL.
Once created, SQream will query the tables, as if they were regular tables.</p>
